# Proposal Tool

This document outlines a proposal for building a tool to manage client details and project requirements.

## 1. Core Features

*   **Client Information Management:** A simple form to input and store client details, including:
    *   Name
    *   Contact Number
    *   Email Address
    *   Website URL
    *   Company Name
*   **Project Requirements:** A section to detail the client's needs and project scope.
*   **Persistence:** Each client's information will be saved as a separate record, allowing for easy retrieval and reference in the future.
*   **Team Collaboration:** A mechanism to share client proposals with team members.

## 2. Proposed Technology Stack

I recommend building this as a web application using the **MERN stack**:

*   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database to store client data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
*   **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework to build the backend API.
*   **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building the user interface, allowing for a dynamic and responsive experience.
*   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime to power the backend server.

This stack is well-suited for creating a modern, scalable, and maintainable application.

## 3. Questions for You

To ensure I build the right tool for your needs, I have a few questions:

1.  **Web Application:** Is a web-based application (accessible through a browser) what you have in mind?
2.  **Sharing:** How do you envision sharing proposals with your team? Should it be a simple link to a read-only page, or do you need more advanced features like role-based access control (e.g., some team members can edit, others can only view)?
3.  **Deployment:** Where would you like to host this application? On a personal server, a cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku), or something else?
4.  **User Interface:** Do you have any specific design or layout ideas for the client details page?

Once I have your feedback on these points, I can create a detailed implementation plan. I'm ready to start building as soon as we've clarified these requirements.
