        		<p>What if every piece of content you created truly resonated — captivating the right people at the right time? The secret isn’t just better writing. It’s understanding who you’re writing for.  When we truly understand our audience, we create not just communication, but connection. When we take time to learn about the people we're trying to reach, we can better serve their needs and build lasting relationships.</p>

             <p>Have you ever shared something important, only to realize the other person wasn’t really listening? Creating content without understanding; your audience feels the same way, your message might be valuable, but it's not reaching the right people in their preferred way? Think of handing a busy parent a 20-page whitepaper when they only have five minutes in the school pickup line. By developing a deep understanding of your readers' challenges, aspirations, and preferences, you can craft content that feels personally relevant and valuable to them.</p>

  					<h2 id="identify-preferences">How to Identify Audience Preferences</h2>
  						<p>Ever feel like you’re guessing what your audience actually wants? That’s where curiosity becomes your superpower. Care deeply about their world, and they’re more likely to care about yours. That’s how trust begins. What assumptions have you made about your audience that might need rethinking? Start by hanging out where they do — online spaces, comment sections, casual conversations. What are they really saying? Pay attention to the language they use, the problems they face, and the solutions they seek. Consider conducting surveys, hosting focus groups, or engaging in social media discussions to learn about their daily experiences. Too often, we create based on assumptions. That’s why I lean on the LLPE framework: Listen, Learn, Personalize, Evolve. It helps me stay person-first, not algorithm-first. This person-centered approach helps ensure your content addresses real needs rather than presumed ones.</p>
  							<br>
  						<p>Inclusivity isn’t a checklist — it’s a commitment to making sure everyone feels seen and heard. Instead of asking ‘What content do you want?’ try:</p>  
  						<ul>
    						<li>‘What’s one thing you wish more people understood about [topic]?’</li>
    						<li>‘What’s been missing from the content you usually see?’</li>
  						</ul>
  						<br>
  						<p>For neurodivergent audiences or non-native speakers, offer multiple ways to respond (e.g., voice response, emoji-based surveys, etc). Partner with community advocates to ensure questions respect cultural nuances.</p>
  						<br>
  						<p><b>Here’s your challenge for the week</b>: Talk to five people you want to serve. Not with a script, but with curiosity. Ask open-ended questions. Listen without fixing. Notice what keeps coming up.</p>

						<h2 id="audience-where">Where Your Audience Hangs Out – and What They Actually Want</h2>
							<p>Want to grow with your audience? Then go where they already are — and speak their language. Research from 2024 shows 52% of Millennials shop on Facebook, drawn to posts that feel like a warm community hug. Meanwhile, 51% of Gen Z shop on TikTok, where playful, short videos make them smile. Gen Z also loves authenticity: 60% prefer user-generated content over polished ads.</p>
							<br>
							<p>What does this mean for you? If your audience skews younger, try a behind-the-scenes TikTok that shows real people using your product. For Millennials, a heartfelt Facebook post or a customer story might be what sticks. Tailor your tone to the space your audience feels most at home in</p>
							<br/>
							<p>No matter your niche, storytelling wins. Whether you’re a local shop or global brand, sharing how your product sparked joy can build trust. It’s not about being everywhere —it’s about showing up in the right places with content that feels like a friend, not a sales pitch.</p>
							<br/>
							<p>So, where are your people? And how will you show up in their world?</p>
							<br/>
							<p>Take a moment. What kind of content you connect with most — something funny, something heartfelt, something real? Share in a comment, reflect privately, or drop us a note. Your insight could inspire someone else navigating the same path.</p>

            <h2 id="reader-personas">Using Data to Create Reader Personas</h2>
              <p>While numbers and analytics are valuable, remember that behind every statistic is a real person with hopes, fears, and dreams. By combining quantitative data with qualitative insights you can develop well-rounded reader personas. By incorporating content personalization into these personas, you can craft experiences that feel tailor-made for your readers, increasing connection and trust.</p>
							<br>

              <h3>A Basic Persona Example</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Core need: 'I want to feel capable, not judged'</li>
                  <li>Daily friction: Limited time between childcare shifts</li>
                  <li>Values: Practicality over perfection, community support</li>
                  <li>Language: nontechnical grade 9-10 aim for grade 8</li>
                  <li>Avoids: Jargon, unrealistic 'hacks'</li>
                  <li>Engagement style: Prefers 5-min audio clips over long articles</li>
                </ul>
								<br>
								<p>Ready to build personas that connect? Here’s a quick checklist, inspired by 2024 research:
									<ul>
										<li>Explore Instagram or TikTok (89% of Gen Z use Instagram, 82% use TikTok) to spot what excites your audience.</li>
										<li>Read comments on these platforms to uncover emotional needs, like wanting fun or belonging.</li>
										<li>Test one post that feels authentic, like a funny Reel, since Gen Z craves entertainment. </li>
									</ul>
									<p>These steps help you see your audience as people, not numbers, creating content that warms hearts locally or globally. So how do you actually see your readers — not just their clicks and scrolls? That’s where research tools and real conversations work together.</p>

							<p>Many accessible tools can help you refine your engagement strategies by gathering insights about your audience’s behaviors, preferences, and challenges. Social media analytics, website behavior tracking, and email engagement metrics all offer valuable perspectives. However, don't let technology overshadow the importance of direct human interaction. Sometimes, a simple conversation can reveal more than pages of analytics data.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Use <a href="https://sparktoro.com/" target="_blank">SparkToro</a> to discover where your audience spends time online (e.g., 'Are they in niche Facebook groups or TikTok communities?'). It’s helpful to discover audience habits.</p>
                <p>Try <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" target="_blank">Hotjar</a>’s free heatmaps to see which blog sections readers linger on, maybe they crave more real-world examples in section 3.  Heatmaps help to analyze your reader's behavior. Beyond basic heatmaps in Hotjar, try using their 'rage click' analysis to pinpoint sections where readers are getting frustrated and confused – this is gold for identifying content gaps.</p>

            <h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes in Audience Targeting</h2>
            	<p>Have you ever assumed your audience wanted one thing, only to find out they needed something completely different? Remember that diversity exists within every category, and intersectionality plays a crucial role in shaping individual perspectives. Without an audience-focused content approach, brands risk missing these nuances and creating messages that don’t fully connect. Another common error is failing to evolve your understanding as your audience changes over time. Content personalization isn’t just about getting it right once –it’s about continuously adjusting to meet shifting needs.</p>
            	
            	<br>
            	
            	<p>A mental health platform once assumed all teens wanted quick tips. After hosting anonymous story-sharing circles, they discovered teens wanted something deeper—long-form ‘hope journeys’ shared by others who’d been through it.</p>
            	
            	<br>
            	
            	<p><b>This reminds us to check</b>:</p>
            	
            	<ul>
								
            		<li>what audiences “say” they want</li>
            		
            		<li>and what they “need”.</li>
            		
            	</ul>
            	
            	<br>
            	
            	<p>Regular check-ins help bridge this gap.</p>
            	
            	<br>
            	
            	<p>Remember, the goal isn't just to gather information about your audience but to develop genuine empathy and understanding. This deeper connection will naturally lead to more authentic, engaging content that serves your readers' needs while building meaningful relationships. By staying curious, open-minded, and responsive to feedback, you can continue to grow and adapt by using LLPE alongside your audience. If we want to build content that adapts with our audience, we need to treat feedback not as criticism—but as a compass.</p>
