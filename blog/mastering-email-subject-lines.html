    <p>We live in the attention economy. And if you’re like most people, your inbox shows it. The average person gets over 120 emails a day, and most subject lines have about two seconds to earn a click. Two seconds. That’s the window where your message either gets opened or deleted.</p>
		<br>
    <p>So, how do we stand out when people are drowning in content?</p>
		<br>
    <p>For many marketers, the answer right now is: AI.</p>
		<br>
    <p>But while AI has changed the game, it hasn’t replaced the most important part — us.</p>

    <h2 id="heading-strengths">Where AI is really good</h2>
    <p>I’ll give AI credit: it’s brilliant at certain things we used to struggle with.</p>

    <h3>Speed and scale:</h3>
    <p>AI can spin out dozens of subject line variations in seconds. What used to take a copy team hours of brainstorming, it does instantly — no writer’s block, no fatigue. That means you can A/B test subject lines constantly, quickly learning what works.</p>

    <h3>Hyper-personalization:</h3>
    <p>AI doesn’t just say “Hi [First Name].” It digs into purchase history, behavior, even browsing patterns. It can create micro-segments, tailoring subject lines to what each customer cares about. Personalized subject lines can lift open rates by over 23%. That’s not a small bump — that’s attention you might have otherwise lost.</p>
		
    <h3>Prediction power:</h3>
    <p>AI looks at what’s worked before — length, sentiment, word choice — and predicts which subject lines will get the most clicks. It can even recommend send times, fine-tuning when people are most likely to open. That’s the kind of optimization that was nearly impossible just a few years ago.</p>

    <h3>Guardrails:</h3>
    <p>It helps spot words that might land your email in the spam folder. It keeps your sender reputation healthy. And it can even mimic your brand tone — to a degree.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Of course, even with sophisticated AI, the human element of messaging clarity remains critical. If you need help making your messaging clearer and more impactful, our <a href="../services/copywriting.html">Message Clarity service</a> can refine your communication for better engagement.</p>

    <h2 id="heading-limitations">But where AI struggles — and humans shine</h2>
    <p>And yet, with all of this… we still need humans. Why? Because sharing isn’t purely logical. It’s emotional. This is where Jonah Berger’s Contagious opened my eyes years ago: ideas spread when they make people feel something, gain status, and want to talk.</p>

    <h3>Emotion and nuance:</h3>
    <p>AI can recognize sentiment, but it doesn’t feel. Humor, sarcasm, empathy — the little touches that make an email feel written for me, those still need a human ear. Without it, AI outputs can feel robotic or too safe. Emotion moves people to share. Research shows that certain words can trigger strong emotional responses, making emails more engaging. For example, a study by the <cite><a href="https://www.advancedmarketinginstitute.com/emotional-marketing-value" target="_blank">Advanced Marketing Institute (AMI)</a></cite> found that subject lines with high Emotional Marketing Value (EMV) can boost engagement by up to 40%.</p>

    <h3>Brand voice and story:</h3>
    <p>Your brand is more than data points. It’s your mission, your values, your personality. Humans bring that authentic voice forward. We tell stories that aren’t just optimized — they’re memorable. And people share stories far more than they share facts. (Contagious taught me that too.)</p>

    <h3>Cultural sensitivity:</h3>
    <p>Humor and references that work in one market may fall flat — or offend — in another. AI lacks true cultural awareness. Humans catch what algorithms miss.</p>

    <h3>Ethical judgment:</h3>
    <p>AI doesn’t have a moral compass. It might push urgency or clickbait too far. Only humans can judge where persuasion crosses into manipulation — and avoid losing long-term trust.</p>

    <h3>Big-picture thinking:</h3>
    <p>AI optimizes what exists. Humans imagine what’s possible. We’re still the ones who spot emerging trends, shift strategies, and break patterns that no dataset would predict.</p>

    <h2 id="heading-collaboration">The best results come from humans and AI working together</h2>
    <p>Instead of fearing AI, we should see it as a powerful partner. Done well, AI handles the heavy lifting — generating, testing, refining — while humans inject the emotional spark that truly connects.</p>
		<br>
    <p>Let me give you a few quick real-world examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CUUP, a lingerie brand, found that AI-generated subject lines featuring phrases like “silky smooth” drove 31% higher open rates than generic offers. But humans still wrote the campaigns that built the brand’s voice.</li>
      <li>The New York Times discovered through AI that longer, ingredient-specific subject lines (like “The Secret to Crispy Tofu”) performed better in their cooking newsletters. But again, human editors crafted the recipes and stories.</li>
      <li>A dental clinic saw AI generate a subject line with a slightly higher open rate — but fewer conversions. The human-written version led to better replies and real patient bookings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The pattern is clear: AI helps get more people to open. But humans make them care enough to act.</p>
		<br>
		<p>And remember, subject lines don’t live in a vacuum. Consistent, compelling messaging matters across every channel. Check out our <a href="../services/social-media-management.html">Social Media Management services</a> to see how compelling messaging works across platforms.</p>

    <h2 id="heading-best-practices">How marketers should approach this right now</h2>
    <p>If you’re responsible for writing emails — whether you’re a solo entrepreneur or inside a larger team — here’s the sweet spot I recommend:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Let AI generate and test variations — use its speed.</li>
      <li>Use your judgment to refine tone, story, and ethics. Don’t let AI write unchecked.</li>
      <li>Always prioritize emotional triggers and social currency. Ask: Would this make someone feel smart, understood, or inspired to share?</li>
      <li>Track real business outcomes — not just open rates. Opens mean nothing if nobody clicks, converts, or replies.</li>
      <li>Keep your brand voice consistent. Feed your AI tools with examples of your best past work, but don’t assume they fully “get” you.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="container" id="conclusion" aria-labelledby="heading-conclusion">
    <h2 id="heading-conclusion">The bottom line</h2>
    <p>AI helps us move faster. But people still share what makes them feel something, look good, and connect with others.</p>
		<br>
    <p>That’s where Contagious helped me long before AI was mainstream: by showing me that spreading an idea isn’t just about volume. It’s about building something people want to talk about.</p>
		<br>
    <p>AI might get us into more inboxes. But humans still give the world something worth sharing.</p>
